## Project Overview

This document covers the frontend for the Signal News App, a real-time AI-powered news aggregation and synthesis platform. The frontend is a React-based client application built with Vite that communicates with a FastAPI backend.

### Key Features
- Real-time report generation with live progress tracking via WebSockets.
- Customizable report preferences (focus, depth, tone).
- Interactive "Tech Pulse" dashboard with data visualizations.
- User authentication (via Supabase) and persistent report history.
- Guest mode with session-based history.
- Report sharing and exporting to PDF.
- Responsive design with dark/light theme support.

## Architecture

### Technology Stack

#### Frontend
- **React 18**: Core UI library for building the user interface.
- **TypeScript**: For static typing and improved developer experience.
- **Vite**: High-performance build tool and development server.
- **React Router DOM**: For client-side routing and navigation.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **Shadcn/ui**: A collection of reusable UI components.
- **Lucide React**: Icon library.
- **Axios**: HTTP client for making requests to the backend API.
- **Supabase Client**: For interacting with Supabase for authentication.

#### Backend
- **FastAPI**: The web framework for the Python-based backend API.
- **Supabase**: Used for the PostgreSQL database and user authentication.

## Getting Started

1.  **Navigate to the client directory:**
    ```bash
    cd signal-app-frontend-restored/client
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the `client` directory and add your Supabase project details:
    ```
    VITE_SUPABASE_URL="your_supabase_project_url"
    VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your_supabase_public_anon_key"
    VITE_API_BASE_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8000"
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Project Structure

The `client/src` directory is organized as follows:

├── components/     # Reusable UI components.
│   ├── home/       # Components specific to the HomePage.
│   ├── report/     # Components specific to the ReportPage.
│   └── ui/         # Base UI components from Shadcn.
├── hooks/          # Custom React hooks (e.g., `useToast`).
├── lib/            # Utility functions and library initializations (e.g., Supabase client).
├── pages/          # Top-level page components.
├── types/          # TypeScript type definitions.
├── App.tsx         # Main application component with routing setup.
└── main.tsx        # Application entry point.
```

## API Layer

The API layer is responsible for all communication with the backend.

### API Configuration (`api/api.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Provides a centralized Axios instance for making HTTP requests to the FastAPI backend.
- **Features**: Sets the base URL and standard headers for all requests.

### Report Generation & History (`api/reports.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Handles all API calls related to generating and managing reports.
- **Functions**:
    - `generateReport(data)`: Initiates the report generation process. It sends an initial HTTP request to get a `job_id` and then establishes a WebSocket connection to receive real-time progress updates and the final report.
    - `getReport(jobId)`: Fetches a single, previously generated report from the backend.
    - `getReportHistory()`: Retrieves the list of reports for the currently authenticated user. Handles guest history via `sessionStorage`.
    - `deleteReport(jobId)`: Deletes a specific report from the user's history.

### Dashboard Data (`api/dashboard.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Fetches and transforms data for the "Tech Pulse" dashboard.
- **Functions**:
    - `getDashboardData()`: Calls the `/api/tech-pulse/latest` backend endpoint and adapts the response data into the format expected by the various dashboard components.

### User History (`api/history.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Manages saving user report history.
- **Functions**:
    - `saveHistory(...)`: Saves a completed report. If the user is logged in, it sends the data to the backend; otherwise, it saves it to the browser's `sessionStorage` for guest users.

## State Management

The application primarily relies on local component state (`useState`) and React context for state management.
- **`HomePage`**: Manages the state for the topic input, generation progress, and user preferences.
- **`ReportPage`**: Manages the state for displaying a single report.
- **`App.tsx`**: Manages a global `reportCount` to update the sidebar when new reports are created.
- **Theme Management**: Uses `next-themes` to manage the application's light/dark theme, persisting the choice in `localStorage`.

## Authentication

- **Supabase**: Authentication is handled via Supabase. The `lib/supabaseClient.ts` file initializes the Supabase client.
- **Auth Flow**:
    1. Users can sign up or log in using Supabase's built-in authentication UI or custom components.
    2. Upon successful login, Supabase provides a JWT (access token).
    3. This token is included in the `Authorization` header for all authenticated API requests to the backend (e.g., fetching or deleting history).
- **Guest Users**: If a user is not logged in, their report history is stored in `sessionStorage` for the duration of their session.

## Routing

- **React Router DOM**: Manages all client-side routing.
- **Routes**:
    - `/`: The main `HomePage`, which includes the dashboard and the report generation input.
    - `/report/:id`: The `ReportPage`, which displays a single generated report, identified by its `job_id`.
- **Layout**: The `LayoutWithSidebar` component provides a consistent structure with a sidebar for navigation and history, and a main content area where the pages are rendered.
